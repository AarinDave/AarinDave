## Welcome to my profile!
Hello, I am a 13-year old Python programmer, and I have extensive experience with Python. I am currently learning about Pygame and GPIO. In the future, I hope to create amazing projects for everyone to see. Furthermore, I believe in an open-source world. Before you leave, check out some of my repositories and check back for more.
