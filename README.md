## Welcome to my profile!
I am a 13-year old Python programmer, and I know a lot about Python and Pygame. I am currently working on GPIO. I hope to create amazing projects for everyone to see, and I believe in an open-source world. Before you leave, check out some of my repositories and check back for more.
