## Welcome to my profile!
Hello, I am a 13-year old Python programmer, and I have extensive experience with Python. I am currently learning Pygame and GPIO. In the future, I hope to create amazing projects for everyone to see on GitHub. Furthermore, I believe in an open-source, transparent world to see how skilled developers create their amazing projects. Before you leave, check out some of my repositories and check back for more.
