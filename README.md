## Welcome to my profile!
Hello, I am a 14-year-old Python and JavaScript hobbyist programmer! I have extensive experience with Python and some experience in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. My mission in GitHub is to make original open-source projects for everyone to see on GitHub. I believe in an open-source, transparent world to see how developers create their amazing, unique, and handcrafted projects. Check out some of my repositories and come back for more!
