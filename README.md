## Welcome to my profile!
Hello, I am a 13-year old Python programmer, and I have extensive experience with Python. I am currently learning Pygame, GPIO, and JavaScript. In the future, I hope to create amazing projects for everyone to see on GitHub. Furthermore, I believe in an open-source, transparent world to see how developers create their amazing, unique, and handcrafted projects. Before you leave, check out some of my repositories and check back for more!
